# (un)SEEN

In the scope of our project (un) S E E N we deal with the context of surveillance capitalism in your own home. 
Our project focuses on the unrecognizable and quickly forgotten collection of your private data by smart home 
solutions and tries to emphasize its ubiquity. We want to create a critical design that visualises the moment 
of data collection as well as how the data is sold and used. In doing so, we aim to show how the collection and 
use of this data has an impact on your own life, thus changing the way how you interact with your smart home 
and the collection of your data by exposing the obvious.
